##This is the home of the Processing Chicago's initiation of the port of Spiral5PTL by Daniel Sandin, Thomas Defanti and Mimi Shevitz for the [ReCode Project](http://recodeproject.com "ReCode Project")*##

###About the Project###
Processing Chicago met on 02/04/2013 to initiate this effort. Daniel Sandin gave a talk on Spiral5PTL at the meeting--watching this video will give folks a good idea about the piece, the open hardware philosophy behind the gear that ran it, and some thoughts that Sandin has about how the port should (hopefully) look and feel.

As this piece was originally performed, the goal is to create a framework that allows new performances.  So, we ask that people who work on this keep it that way.  That can take any form one prefers, e.g. a Processing UI library (like controlP5), Processing talking to an Arduino + knobs, buttons, etc.

Key tenets of this port are:

*  Maintain the artifacts caused by the PDP-11 Vector General Calligraphic Display, such as slowly decaying visual forms.

*	Accompanying sounds similar to what was done originally on an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer.

*	Provide a user interface that allows ease of performance, and the ability to change parameters of the piece quickly and easily, with the ability to save certain states for resuse.


*The ReCode Project “is a community-driven effort to preserve computer art by translating it into a modern programming language (Processing). Every translated work will be available to the public to learn from, share, and build on.”
